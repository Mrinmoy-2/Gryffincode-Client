            Welcome to GryffinCode, where the magic of coding meets the
            enchantment of the Harry Potter universe! We are a team of
            final-year students from Lovely Professional University, deeply
            passionate about both the wizarding world and the wonders of science
            and technology. Our capstone project, GryffinCode, is our
            spellbinding effort to make coding as thrilling as a Quidditch match
            and as rewarding as earning House Points.

          <p className="font-potter text-[1.2rem] mt-10">
            At GryffinCode, our mission is to blend the excitement of the Harry
            Potter series with the intellectual challenge of coding. We strive
            to create an engaging platform where learning to code is an
            adventure, and every achievement is celebrated with the same
            enthusiasm as winning the House Cup. Our goal is to foster a
            community of coders who are as passionate about their craft as they
            are about their favorite wizarding house.
